	<p>Common Good Resources aspires to initiate and organize events to better promote peace, mutual respect, coexistence, tolerance through cultural means such as film, music, sports, photography and social gatherings. Common Good Resources is dedicated to using culture as a catalyst to inspire and educate ordinary people around the globe to initiate positive change in their local communities and worldwide.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Faced by war, violence, famine, climate change, extremism and partially empowered by technology, social media and more accessible information, millions for the first time in their lives encounter drastically different living conditions, political views, personal choices and beliefs. </p>
	<br />
	<p>Cultural events such as film, music photography and intellectual gatherings are powerful tools that can be used to contain most of the answers for such questions. By reaching masses through new media and traditional means of communication, cultural events can contribute to creating an atmosphere for respect, dialogue, tolerance and moderation.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Respecting the difference should become the new norm for a more peaceful world. Common Good Resources collaborates with partners from around the world to promote cultural dialogue and mutual respect.</p>
